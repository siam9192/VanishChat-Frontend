# 🕵️‍♂️ Vanish Chat 

**Vanish Chat** is a real-time, room-based chat web app designed for quick and private conversations. Users can create or join chat rooms using unique room codes—no authentication required. All messages exist only during the life of the room and automatically vanish once the room is closed, ensuring nothing is stored or saved.

It's ideal for temporary group discussions, spontaneous team collaboration, or secure, short-lived chats where privacy and simplicity are key.
